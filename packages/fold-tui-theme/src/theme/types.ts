	 * smuggles cool fringes into an all-warm palette. Set to `0` to disable.

	 * -- Injection: PAINT corrupt colour the whole-frame pass cannot produce. --
	 * A burst sometimes stamps solid colour blocks (over the bg, forcing a filled
	 * rectangle — including over the logo and borders) and sometimes replaces a run
	 * of foregrounds with one chosen corrupt hue. Unlike the `color` row-kind, which
	 * smears a *neighbour's* colour, these inject a *chosen* colour.
	 *
	 * Every hue is a theme token (no literal may live outside theme/*). TACTICAL
	 * supplies warm tones + red + grays only — nothing cool; RAPTURE may add its
	 * teal/purple. `postfx` parses these to RGB once per install, never per frame.
